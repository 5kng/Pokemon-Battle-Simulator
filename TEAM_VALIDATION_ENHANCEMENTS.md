## Validation Categories

### Critical Issues ‚ùå
- Empty team name or missing Pokemon
- Too many Pokemon or moves
- Invalid Pokemon or move selections

### Warning Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Type coverage vulnerabilities (team weak to common types)
- Type diversity problems (too many of same type)

- Statistical imbalances (very low HP, speed, etc.)
- High legendary count

### Info Suggestions üí°
- Missing status moves
- Incomplete movesets (less than 4 moves per Pokemon)
- Missing type coverage opportunities
- General team improvement suggestions

## Analysis Features

### Type Coverage Analysis
- Identifies vulnerabilities to common threat types
- Analyzes resistance patterns across the team
- Provides specific type recommendations

### Move Balance Analysis
- Physical/Special/Status move distribution
- Move type coverage assessment
- Identifies missing move categories

### Statistical Analysis
- Average base stat calculations
- Team strength and weakness identification
- Speed and bulk analysis

### Smart Suggestions
- Context-aware improvement recommendations
- Specific Pokemon suggestions for team gaps
- Move recommendations for better coverage
- Priority-based suggestion ordering

## Usage Examples

### Team Analysis Mode
```
üîç TEAM ANALYSIS MODE
Choose which team to analyze:
[1] üåø Balanced Team
[2] ‚ö° Competitive Team  
[3] üî• Mixed Team
```

### Enhanced Validation Output
```
üîç ENHANCED TEAM VALIDATION RESULTS
‚úÖ Team passes basic validation!

‚ùå Critical Issues (Must Fix):
‚Ä¢ [Type Coverage] Team is vulnerable to: rock, ground, fighting, fire
  ‚Üí Consider adding Pokemon resistant to these types

üí° Suggestions (Optional Improvements):
‚Ä¢ [Move Balance] No status moves in team
  ‚Üí Consider adding status moves like Thunder Wave, Toxic, or Sleep Powder

üöÄ Quick Improvement Tips:
1. Add Pokemon resistant to: rock, ground, fighting
2. Add status moves like Thunder Wave, Toxic, or Sleep Powder
3. Add moves with Rock, Flying, Ice, or Electric coverage
```

### Detailed Team Analysis
```
üìä DETAILED TEAM ANALYSIS

üè∑Ô∏è Type Distribution:
grass: 1 Pokemon
electric: 1 Pokemon
fighting: 1 Pokemon
fire: 1 Pokemon
water: 1 Pokemon
normal: 1 Pokemon

‚öîÔ∏è Move Balance:
Physical: 4 (50%)
Special: 4 (50%)
Status: 0 (0%)

üìà Average Base Stats:
HP:              97
Attack:          95
Defense:         71
Speed:           68

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Weaknesses:
Vulnerable to: rock, ground, fighting, fire
```

## Technical Implementation

### File Changes
- **`include/core/team_builder.h`**: Enhanced with new validation structures and methods
- **`src/core/team_builder.cpp`**: Comprehensive implementation of all validation logic
- **`src/main.cpp`**: Integrated enhanced validation into user interface

### Dependencies
- Uses existing `TypeEffectiveness` class for type matchup calculations
- Integrates with existing `PokemonData` system for Pokemon/move information
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy validation methods

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient type effectiveness calculations
- Minimal memory overhead with smart data structures
- Fast analysis algorithms suitable for real-time use

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

1. **Move Synergy Analysis**: Detect move combinations that work well together
2. **Team Role Analysis**: Identify sweepers, walls, support Pokemon
3. **Weather Team Support**: Analyze weather-based team strategies
4. **Competitive Format Validation**: Support for different battle formats
5. **Team Export/Import**: Save and share team analyses
6. **Advanced AI Suggestions**: Machine learning-based team recommendations

## Conclusion

The enhanced team validation system transforms the Pokemon Battle Simulator from a basic team builder into a comprehensive team analysis tool. Users now receive detailed, actionable feedback that helps them understand team construction principles and build more effective teams for competitive play.

The system strikes a balance between providing helpful guidance and maintaining user agency, allowing players to proceed with suboptimal teams while understanding the implications of their choices.
