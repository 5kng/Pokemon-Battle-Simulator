### Architecture Implementation Details

#### State Management Pattern

```cpp
// Clean state transitions with validation
void Pokemon::startCharging(int moveIndex, const std::string& moveName) {
    // Validation
    if (is_charging || must_recharge) return;
    if (moveIndex < 0 || moveIndex >= moves.size()) return;
    
    // Safe state transition
    is_charging = true;
    charging_move_index = moveIndex;
    charging_move_name = moveName;
}

void Pokemon::finishCharging() {
    is_charging = false;
    charging_move_index = -1;
    charging_move_name.clear();
}
```

#### Battle Integration Pattern

```cpp
// Comprehensive move execution with multi-turn support
void Battle::executeMove(Pokemon &attacker, Pokemon &defender, int moveIndex) {
    Move &move = attacker.moves[moveIndex];
    
    // Handle recharge constraint
    if (attacker.must_recharge) {
        std::cout << attacker.name << " must recharge!" << std::endl;
        attacker.finishRecharge();
        return;
    }
    
    // Handle charging phase
    if (move.requiresCharging() && !attacker.is_charging) {
        attacker.startCharging(moveIndex, move.name);
        
        // Apply charge-time effects (Skull Bash defense boost)
        if (move.boostsDefenseOnCharge()) {
            attacker.modifyDefense(1);
        }
        
        // Weather-dependent charge skip (Solar Beam)
        if (move.skipChargeInSunnyWeather() && currentWeather == WeatherCondition::SUNNY) {
            attacker.finishCharging();
            // Continue to move execution
        } else {
            return; // End turn, move executes next turn
        }
    }
    
    // Execute the move
    if (attacker.is_charging) {
        attacker.finishCharging();
    }
    
    // Standard move execution
    executeMoveEffects(attacker, defender, move);
    
    // Handle post-move recharge requirement
    if (move.requiresRecharge()) {
        attacker.startRecharge();
    }
}
```

## Security and Validation Measures

### Input Validation

#### Move Data Validation
```cpp
// Safe JSON loading with validation
void Move::loadFromJson(const std::string &file_path) {
    try {
        nlohmann::json moveJson;
        std::ifstream file(file_path);
        
        if (!file.is_open()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Cannot open move file: " + file_path);
        }
        
        file >> moveJson;
        
        // Validate required fields
        if (!moveJson.contains("name") || !moveJson.contains("Info")) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Invalid move data structure");
        }
        
        // Safe multi-turn behavior loading
        auto& info = moveJson["Info"];
        if (info.contains("multi_turn_behavior")) {
            std::string behavior = info["multi_turn_behavior"];
            multi_turn_behavior = parseMultiTurnBehavior(behavior);
        } else {
            multi_turn_behavior = MultiTurnBehavior::NONE;
        }
        
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error loading move " << file_path << ": " << e.what() << std::endl;
        // Set safe defaults
        multi_turn_behavior = MultiTurnBehavior::NONE;
    }
}
```

#### State Transition Validation
```cpp
// Bounds checking and state validation
void Pokemon::startCharging(int moveIndex, const std::string& moveName) {
    // Validate move index
    if (moveIndex < 0 || moveIndex >= static_cast<int>(moves.size())) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Invalid move index " << moveIndex << std::endl;
        return;
    }
    
    // Validate current state
    if (is_charging || must_recharge) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Cannot start charging in current state" << std::endl;
        return;
    }
    
    // Validate move requirements
    if (!moves[moveIndex].requiresCharging()) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Attempting to charge non-charging move" << std::endl;
        return;
    }
    
    // Safe state transition
    is_charging = true;
    charging_move_index = moveIndex;
    charging_move_name = moveName;
}
```

### Memory Safety

- **No Dynamic Allocation:** Multi-turn state uses fixed member variables
- **Automatic Cleanup:** State resets on Pokemon switching/fainting
- **Bounds Checking:** All array accesses validated
- **Exception Safety:** Graceful handling of invalid configurations

### Thread Safety

- **Read-Only Operations:** Multi-turn queries are thread-safe
- **Atomic Updates:** State transitions designed for single-threaded use
- **No Global State:** Each Pokemon maintains independent multi-turn state

## Backward Compatibility

### Compatibility Analysis

#### Existing Move Compatibility
```cpp
// All existing moves default to NONE behavior
Move tackle("tackle");
assert(tackle.getMultiTurnBehavior() == MultiTurnBehavior::NONE);
assert(!tackle.isMultiTurnMove());
assert(!tackle.requiresCharging());
assert(!tackle.requiresRecharge());
```

#### Save/Load Compatibility
- **JSON Format:** No breaking changes to existing Pokemon/move data
- **State Persistence:** Multi-turn state is runtime-only (no save corruption)
- **Migration:** No data migration required for existing saves

#### API Compatibility
- **Existing Methods:** All current Move/Pokemon methods unchanged
- **New Methods:** Multi-turn methods are additive only
- **Behavior Preservation:** Default behavior for undefined multi-turn fields

### Version Migration Strategy

#### Forward Compatibility
```cpp
// Graceful handling of unknown multi-turn behaviors
MultiTurnBehavior parseMultiTurnBehavior(const std::string& behavior) {
    static const std::unordered_map<std::string, MultiTurnBehavior> BEHAVIOR_MAP = {
        {"none", MultiTurnBehavior::NONE},
        {"charge", MultiTurnBehavior::CHARGE},
        {"recharge", MultiTurnBehavior::RECHARGE},
        {"charge_boost", MultiTurnBehavior::CHARGE_BOOST}
    };
    
    auto it = BEHAVIOR_MAP.find(behavior);
    if (it != BEHAVIOR_MAP.end()) {
        return it->second;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Unknown multi-turn behavior '" << behavior 
                  << "', defaulting to NONE" << std::endl;
        return MultiTurnBehavior::NONE;
    }
}
```
