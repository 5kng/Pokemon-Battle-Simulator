## Expert AI Evaluation Methods

### Overview
The Expert AI system implements a sophisticated multi-factor evaluation approach with 5 specialized methods that contribute to move scoring. Each method analyzes different strategic aspects and applies weighted scoring to determine optimal moves.

### Implemented Evaluation Methods

#### 1. `evaluateLongTermAdvantage()` (Weight: 0.3x)
**Purpose:** Assesses strategic positioning across multiple turns
**Scoring Range:** -15.0 to +15.0 points (after 0.3x weight)
**Key Factors:**
- Team health differential analysis (HP percentage comparison)
- Status condition duration evaluation (+25 points for opponent status, -20 for own status)
- Stat stage advantages (net boost comparison with 2x multiplier)
- Type coverage gaps identification

**Implementation Details:**
- Calculates total team health ratios for long-term resource assessment
- Applies bonus scoring for lasting opponent status conditions (15+ for >2 turns)
- Evaluates accumulated stat boosts as cumulative advantages

#### 2. `detectSetupAttempt()` (Weight: 2.0x)  
**Purpose:** Identifies opponent setup patterns and timing
**Scoring Range:** -50.0 to +50.0 points (after 2.0x weight)
**Key Factors:**
- Pattern recognition for stat-boosting moves (Dragon Dance, Calm Mind, etc.)
- Turn sequence analysis for setup timing detection
- Health-based setup opportunity assessment
- Threat level evaluation post-setup

**Implementation Details:**
- Monitors opponent move history for setup move usage patterns
- Calculates setup threat multiplier based on opponent's current stat stages
- Applies urgency scoring when opponent health is conducive to setup attempts

#### 3. `evaluateCounterPlay()` (Weight: 1.5x)
**Purpose:** Analyzes switching and revenge kill opportunities  
**Scoring Range:** -37.5 to +37.5 points (after 1.5x weight)
**Key Factors:**
- Switch timing analysis for optimal positioning
- Revenge kill opportunity identification 
- Type matchup exploitation timing
- Speed tier advantage assessment

**Implementation Details:**
- Evaluates current matchup favorability vs switching opportunities
- Scores revenge kill potential based on opponent health thresholds
- Considers speed control advantages for counter-attack timing

#### 4. `assessPositionalAdvantage()` (Weight: 1.2x)
**Purpose:** Evaluates battlefield control and tactical positioning
**Scoring Range:** -30.0 to +30.0 points (after 1.2x weight)  
**Key Factors:**
- Speed control analysis (who moves first advantages)
- Type matchup effectiveness evaluation
- Field effect and weather condition optimization
- Move priority and turn order implications

**Implementation Details:**
- Compares speed stats with stat stage modifications
- Applies type effectiveness multipliers to position scoring
- Evaluates weather/terrain synergy with current active Pokemon

#### 5. `evaluateResourceManagement()` (Weight: 0.8x)
**Purpose:** Optimizes PP usage and team resource allocation
**Scoring Range:** -20.0 to +20.0 points (after 0.8x weight)
**Key Factors:**
- PP conservation analysis across team members
- HP preservation strategy evaluation  
- Move efficiency scoring (damage per PP optimization)
- Team depth resource planning

**Implementation Details:**
- Tracks remaining PP across all moves and team members
- Calculates efficiency ratios for high-power vs low-PP moves
- Applies conservation bonuses when teammates provide strategic depth

### Scoring Integration Model

**Total Move Score Formula:**
```
Total Score = Base Score + 
              (evaluateLongTermAdvantage() * 0.3) +
              (detectSetupAttempt() * 2.0) +
              (evaluateCounterPlay() * 1.5) +
              (assessPositionalAdvantage() * 1.2) +
              (evaluateResourceManagement() * 0.8)
```

**Weight Rationale:**
- **Setup Detection (2.0x):** Highest priority - preventing opponent setup is critical
- **Counter-play (1.5x):** High priority - timing switches and revenge kills optimally
- **Positional (1.2x):** Medium priority - battlefield control advantages
- **Resource (0.8x):** Lower priority - efficiency over raw conservation
- **Long-term (0.3x):** Background factor - strategic positioning context

**Tie-breaking:** When total scores are equal, the move with the highest individual evaluation method score is selected.

### Determinism and Testing

**Deterministic Guarantees:**
- All evaluation methods use deterministic calculations only
- No randomization in scoring logic
- Consistent results across identical game states
- Fixed-seed RNG for any probability calculations

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests verify each evaluation method independently
- Integration tests confirm proper weight application  
- Deterministic test harness ensures reproducible results
- Performance benchmarks validate sub-second execution times

### Strategic Vision Progress
**Phase 1 (COMPLETE):** Core functionality restoration
- **✅ MiniMax Search Engine:** Now receives properly simulated distinct game states
