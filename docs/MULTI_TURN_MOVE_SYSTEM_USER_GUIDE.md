**Date:** August 20, 2025  
**Target Audience:** Players, Battle Strategists, Pokemon Trainers  

## Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for using Multi-Turn Moves in the Pokemon Battle Simulator! This system brings authentic Pokemon battle mechanics to your battles, featuring moves that require multiple turns to execute but offer powerful strategic advantages.

**What are Multi-Turn Moves?**  
Multi-Turn Moves are special Pokemon moves that don't execute in a single turn. Instead, they require either charging time before attacking or force a recharge period after use. These moves typically offer higher power or special effects to compensate for their timing requirements.

## Quick Start Guide

### Your First Multi-Turn Move

1. **Start a battle** with a Pokemon that knows a multi-turn move
2. **Select the multi-turn move** from your move menu
3. **Observe the charging/execution** - the game will guide you through each phase
4. **Plan your strategy** - consider when to use these powerful but timing-dependent moves

### Basic Strategy Tips

- **Hyper Beam:** Use to finish weakened opponents (remember the recharge!)
- **Solar Beam:** Combine with sunny weather for immediate power
- **Sky Attack:** High damage with critical hit potential
- **Skull Bash:** Gain defense while preparing a strong attack

## Multi-Turn Move Types

### Type 1: Recharge Moves

**How They Work:** Execute immediately with high power, then require a recharge turn

#### Hyper Beam
**Power:** 150 | **PP:** 5 | **Accuracy:** 90%  
**Type:** Normal (Special Attack)

**Battle Flow:**
```
Turn 1: "Hyper Beam!" → Massive damage to opponent
Turn 2: "Must recharge!" → Cannot move or switch
Turn 3: Normal moves available again
```

**When to Use:**
- ✅ **Finishing Move:** When opponent has low HP
- ✅ **Breaking Defenses:** Against highly defensive Pokemon  
- ✅ **STAB Damage:** Normal-type Pokemon for extra power
- ❌ **Avoid:** When opponent can set up during recharge
- ❌ **Avoid:** When you need to switch immediately after

**Strategic Example:**
```
Opponent's Blastoise: 60 HP remaining
Your Snorlax: Use Hyper Beam (150 power + STAB = ~225 damage)
Result: Guaranteed knockout, recharge is worth the trade-off
```

### Type 2: Charging Moves

**How They Work:** Require a charging turn before the attack executes

#### Solar Beam  
**Power:** 120 | **PP:** 10 | **Accuracy:** 100%  
**Type:** Grass (Special Attack)

**Battle Flow (Normal Weather):**
```
Turn 1: "Charging up!" → No damage, vulnerable to switches
Turn 2: "Solar Beam!" → 120 power Grass attack
```

**Battle Flow (Sunny Weather):**
```
Turn 1: "Took in sunlight!" → 120 power attack immediately!
```

**When to Use:**
- ✅ **Sunny Weather:** Immediate 120-power move with weather
- ✅ **STAB Attack:** Powerful Grass-type move for Grass Pokemon
- ✅ **Predictable Opponent:** When you expect opponent to stay in
- ❌ **Avoid:** Against opponents likely to switch during charging
- ❌ **Avoid:** Without weather support unless guaranteed safe

**Weather Synergy:**
```
Turn 1: Use "Sunny Day" → Weather changes to sunny
Turn 2: Use "Solar Beam" → Immediate execution (no charging!)
Result: 120-power move without charging vulnerability
```

#### Sky Attack
**Power:** 140 | **PP:** 5 | **Accuracy:** 90%  
**Type:** Flying (Physical Attack)

**Battle Flow:**
```
Turn 1: "Sky Attack preparation!" → No damage, building energy
Turn 2: "Sky Attack!" → 140 power + 30% flinch chance + higher crit rate
```

**Special Features:**
- **High Critical Hit Rate:** Increased chance for double damage
- **Flinch Chance:** 30% chance to prevent opponent's next move
- **Flying Type:** Effective against Fighting, Bug, Grass types

**When to Use:**
- ✅ **Type Advantage:** Against Fighting, Bug, or Grass Pokemon
- ✅ **Critical Hit Setup:** When you need maximum damage potential
- ✅ **Flinch Strategy:** To potentially disrupt opponent's plans
- ❌ **Avoid:** Against Electric or Rock types (type disadvantage)
- ❌ **Avoid:** When opponent can easily switch to resist

### Type 3: Charge-Boost Moves

**How They Work:** Charging turn provides stat boost before attack

#### Skull Bash
**Power:** 130 | **PP:** 10 | **Accuracy:** 100%  
**Type:** Normal (Physical Attack)

**Battle Flow:**
```
Turn 1: "Defense rose!" + "Charging up!" → +1 Defense stage boost
Turn 2: "Skull Bash!" → 130 power attack (with improved defense)
```

**Unique Benefits:**
- **Defensive Boost:** +1 Defense stage persists after the move
- **Dual Purpose:** Offensive move that improves your defense
- **Guaranteed Accuracy:** 100% accuracy ensures reliable execution

**When to Use:**
- ✅ **Setup Strategy:** When you want to boost defense while attacking
- ✅ **Physical Bulk:** Against opponents using physical attacks
- ✅ **Safe Positioning:** When charging turn is relatively safe
- ❌ **Avoid:** Against special attackers (defense boost less useful)
- ❌ **Avoid:** When you need immediate damage without setup

## Strategic Applications

### Weather-Based Strategies

#### Sunny Day + Solar Beam Combo
**Setup:**
1. Lead with a Pokemon that knows both Sunny Day and Solar Beam
2. Use Sunny Day to change weather (may take damage this turn)
3. Use Solar Beam next turn for immediate 120-power attack
4. Continue with Solar Beam for ongoing pressure

**Team Example:**
```
Venusaur @ Leftovers
- Sunny Day (weather setup)
- Solar Beam (immediate in sun)
- Growth (stat boost in sun)  
- Hidden Power Fire (coverage in sun)
```

#### Countering Solar Beam
**Defensive Options:**
- **Switch Pokemon:** Change to resist Grass-type attacks
- **Change Weather:** Rain Dance, Hail, or Sandstorm
- **Use Setup Moves:** Boost your stats while opponent charges
- **Apply Pressure:** Force opponent to reconsider charging

### Multi-Turn Move Counters

#### Dealing with Charging Moves
**Strategies:**
1. **Switching:** Change to a Pokemon that resists the incoming attack
2. **Status Moves:** Paralyze or put opponent to sleep during charging
3. **Setup Opportunities:** Use the "free turn" to boost your stats
4. **Positioning:** Switch to a Pokemon that can handle the attack

**Example Counter-Play:**
```
Opponent's Charizard is charging Solar Beam
Your Options:
- Switch to Blastoise (resists Grass attacks)
- Use Toxic to poison during charge
- Switch to Fire-type (resists Grass + Fire coverage)
```

#### Dealing with Recharge Moves
**Strategies:**
1. **Setup Moves:** Use recharge turn to boost stats safely
2. **Switching:** Bring in a Pokemon to handle opponent's team
3. **Status Application:** Apply sleep, paralysis, or poison
4. **Healing:** Use recovery moves during safe recharge turn

**Example Counter-Play:**
```
Opponent's Snorlax used Hyper Beam (must recharge next turn)
Your Options:
- Use Swords Dance for +2 Attack boost
- Switch to Fighting-type for super effective coverage
- Use Thunder Wave to paralyze during recharge
```

### Advanced Timing Strategies

#### Predicting Opponent Moves
**Key Considerations:**
- **Type Matchups:** Will opponent stay in for the attack?
- **Health Totals:** Can opponent survive the incoming move?
- **Opponent's Team:** What switches are available to them?
- **Game State:** Is this early, mid, or late game?

#### Risk Assessment
**Low Risk Scenarios:**
- Opponent has no good switch options
- Your move will knock out opponent regardless
- Opponent is statused and unlikely to switch
- You have significant type advantage

**High Risk Scenarios:**  
- Opponent has multiple good switch options
- Your move won't knock out opponent
- Opponent can set up during your charge/recharge
- Type matchup is neutral or unfavorable

### Team Building with Multi-Turn Moves

#### Core Strategy Principles
1. **Weather Support:** Include weather setters for Solar Beam
2. **Switch Coverage:** Have Pokemon to handle common counters
3. **Speed Control:** Ensure you can handle faster opponents
4. **Backup Plans:** Don't rely solely on multi-turn moves

#### Sample Team Core
```
Pokemon 1: Weather Setter + Solar Beam
- Primary: Solar Beam for sunny weather damage
- Support: Sunny Day for weather control
- Coverage: Additional moves for non-Grass targets

Pokemon 2: Physical Wall + Skull Bash  
- Primary: Skull Bash for defense + offense
- Support: Recovery move for longevity
- Utility: Status moves for team support

Pokemon 3: Cleanup + Hyper Beam
- Primary: High-power moves for damage
- Finisher: Hyper Beam for knockout power
- Speed: Fast enough to secure knockouts
```

## Battle Scenarios and Examples

### Scenario 1: Solar Beam Weather Control

**Situation:** Your Venusaur vs Opponent's Gyarados  
**Challenge:** Gyarados resists Grass moves, you need type advantage

**Solution:**
```
Turn 1: Use "Sunny Day"
- Weather changes to sunny
- Gyarados may attack or switch

Turn 2: Use "Solar Beam" 
- No charging required due to sunny weather
- 120 power Grass attack
- Neutral damage but high power

Alternative Turn 2: If Gyarados switched
- Assess new opponent
- Continue with Solar Beam or switch strategy
```

### Scenario 2: Hyper Beam Finishing

**Situation:** Your Snorlax vs Opponent's weakened Alakazam (45 HP)  
**Challenge:** Need to knock out before Alakazam can retaliate

**Solution:**
```
Turn 1: Use "Hyper Beam"
- 150 power + STAB = ~225 damage
- Guaranteed knockout on 45 HP Alakazam
- Accept recharge turn as fair trade

Turn 2: Must recharge
- Opponent sends in next Pokemon
- Plan your response for turn 3
```

### Scenario 3: Sky Attack Critical Hit

**Situation:** Your Aerodactyl vs Opponent's Machamp  
**Challenge:** Need maximum damage with type advantage

**Solution:**
```
Turn 1: Use "Sky Attack" (charging)
- Machamp is Fighting-type (weak to Flying)
- High crit rate increases damage potential
- Flinch chance can prevent Machamp's attack

Turn 2: Sky Attack executes
- 140 power × 2 (type advantage) = 280 base damage
- Higher critical hit chance for potential double damage
- 30% flinch chance to stop Machamp's response
```

### Scenario 4: Skull Bash Setup

**Situation:** Your Rhydon vs Opponent's Golem  
**Challenge:** Both are physical attackers, need defensive edge

**Solution:**
```
Turn 1: Use "Skull Bash" (charging + defense boost)
- +1 Defense stage improves physical bulk
- Charging for powerful Normal-type attack
- Golem likely to attack with physical move

Turn 2: Skull Bash executes
- 130 power attack with improved defense
- Reduced damage from Golem's physical attacks
- Maintained defensive advantage for future turns
```

## Multi-Turn Move Interactions

### Status Conditions + Multi-Turn Moves

#### Paralysis Interactions
**During Charging:**
- Paralysis can prevent move execution
- Charging state persists if paralyzed
- 25% chance to be unable to move each turn

**During Recharge:**
- Paralysis during recharge still counts as recharge turn
- Pokemon recovers from recharge normally after paralysis

**Strategic Notes:**
- Consider paralysis risk when using charging moves
- Thunder Wave can disrupt opponent's charging moves
- Paralysis doesn't reset multi-turn state

#### Sleep Interactions
**During Charging:**
- Sleep interrupts charging sequence
- Must restart charging when awake
- Sleep Talk cannot select charging moves

**During Recharge:**
- Sleep during recharge ends recharge requirement
- Pokemon can move normally when awake
- Rest during recharge can be strategic

### Weather Effects on Multi-Turn Moves

#### Sunny Day Effects
**Solar Beam:** Skips charging phase completely
**Other Moves:** No direct effect on charging/recharge
**Strategic Value:** Makes Solar Beam immediately powerful

#### Rain Dance Effects  
**Solar Beam:** Normal charging required (no skip)
**Future Enhancement:** May reduce Solar Beam power
**Strategic Value:** Counters sunny weather strategies

#### Hail/Sandstorm Effects
**Solar Beam:** Normal charging required
**All Moves:** Standard multi-turn mechanics apply
**Environmental Damage:** Applies normally during charging/recharge

### Multi-Turn Moves + Switching

#### Switching Restrictions
**Cannot Switch:**
- During charging phase of any move
- During recharge phase after Hyper Beam
- Pokemon is "locked in" to complete sequence

**Strategic Implications:**
- Opponent cannot escape during your charging
- You cannot escape during opponent's charging
- Plan switches before committing to multi-turn moves

**Exception Handling:**
- Pokemon fainting immediately ends multi-turn sequence
- Status conditions can interrupt but don't break restrictions
- Forced switches (Roar, etc.) override multi-turn locks

## Troubleshooting and Common Mistakes

### Common Player Mistakes

#### Mistake 1: Using Hyper Beam Too Early
**Problem:** Using Hyper Beam when opponent can exploit recharge turn  
**Solution:** Save Hyper Beam for finishing weakened opponents  
**Example:** Don't use Hyper Beam against healthy opponents who can set up

#### Mistake 2: Solar Beam Without Weather
**Problem:** Using Solar Beam in normal weather without considering switches  
**Solution:** Set up weather first or ensure opponent cannot switch safely  
**Example:** Use Sunny Day before Solar Beam, or trap opponent in battle

#### Mistake 3: Charging Into Disadvantage
**Problem:** Starting charging moves when opponent has type advantage  
**Solution:** Consider type matchups before committing to charging  
**Example:** Don't charge Sky Attack against Electric-type Pokemon

#### Mistake 4: Ignoring Speed Tiers
**Problem:** Not considering turn order when using multi-turn moves  
**Solution:** Know your speed relative to opponent's team  
**Example:** Faster Pokemon can disrupt charging with status moves

### Technical Issues and Solutions

#### Move Not Executing
**Symptoms:** Multi-turn move doesn't work as expected  
**Common Causes:**
- Status condition preventing action (paralysis, sleep)
- Pokemon was switched out during sequence
- Move was interrupted by external effect

**Solutions:**
- Check for status conditions affecting Pokemon
- Verify Pokemon hasn't been forced to switch
- Restart multi-turn sequence if interrupted

#### Weather Not Working
**Symptoms:** Solar Beam still charges in sunny weather  
**Common Causes:**
- Weather ended before Solar Beam use
- Different weather condition active
- Weather was overridden by opponent

**Solutions:**
- Check current weather status before using Solar Beam
- Plan for weather duration (5 turns standard)
- Have backup weather setters on team

#### AI Behavior Questions
**Symptoms:** AI using multi-turn moves unexpectedly  
**Explanation:**
- AI considers multi-turn moves in strategy
- Different difficulty levels use different logic
- AI may prioritize type advantage over timing risk

**Understanding AI Behavior:**
- Easy AI: Uses moves randomly including multi-turn
- Medium AI: Basic type effectiveness consideration

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I switch Pokemon during charging?
**A:** No, Pokemon cannot switch during charging or recharge phases. You must complete the multi-turn sequence before switching is allowed.

### Q: What happens if my Pokemon is paralyzed while charging?
**A:** Paralysis can prevent move execution, but the charging state persists. If paralysis prevents the move, you'll remain in charging state and can try again next turn.

### Q: Does Solar Beam work immediately in all sunny weather?
**A:** Yes, Solar Beam skips the charging phase whenever Sunny Day weather is active, regardless of how the weather was set.

### Q: Can AI Pokemon use multi-turn moves effectively?
**A:** Yes, AI at all difficulty levels can use multi-turn moves. Higher difficulties use more strategic timing and consider charging/recharge vulnerability.

### Q: What happens if Pokemon faints during charging/recharge?
**A:** Multi-turn sequences end immediately when Pokemon faints. The next Pokemon sent out starts in normal state with no multi-turn restrictions.

### Q: Are multi-turn moves worth the risk?
**A:** It depends on the situation. Multi-turn moves offer high power or special effects to compensate for timing requirements. They're most valuable when:
- You can guarantee the attack will land
- Opponent has limited switch options  
- The power is needed to secure important knockouts
- You have weather support (for Solar Beam)

### Q: How do I counter opponents using multi-turn moves?
**A:** Common counter-strategies include:
- Switching to resist the incoming attack
- Using the charging turn to set up your own Pokemon
- Applying status conditions during charging
- Changing weather to disrupt Solar Beam strategies

### Q: Can multi-turn moves miss?
**A:** Yes, multi-turn moves can miss based on their accuracy (Hyper Beam: 90%, Solar Beam: 100%, Sky Attack: 90%, Skull Bash: 100%). Missing ends the multi-turn sequence.
